### Figure 1: World Maps of Daily Temperature Variation and Population Density

#### Population Density

The worldâ€™s annual mean daily temperature variation data in Fig. 1 is from the WorldClim v2 dataset 1970-2000, publicly available on their website (https://www.worldclim.com/version2). 

#### Daily Temperature Variations

The population density data is from the NASA Center for International Earth Science Information Network at Columbia University. We use the gridded population of the world v4 in 2000-2020 (https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4).
